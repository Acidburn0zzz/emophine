* FAQ i18n support and better design (hard to see the questions list at the
  moment)

* Guides rework: better list page, i18n support, editor access with images
  upload?

* Compatibility list autocompletion support

* Compatibility stats on the front page? Would be nice imho, but need to find a
  place to put it
