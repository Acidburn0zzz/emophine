* Porting to Python 3 and latest Django (currently on old versions).

* Using more of django-annoying where it makes sense, particularly @render_to.

* Making it easier to test changes locally. Dependencies on the Wiki make that
  a bit hard.

* Download system rework: currently the download types are hardcoded, which was
  a terrible idea and is now blocking us to add things like Android downloads,
  updated Ubuntu builds, etc.
  * Should be a DownloadableItem: {version, url, autodetection_thingy} in DB.
  * Then need a script to port old data to the new format.

* FAQ i18n support and better design (hard to see the questions list at the
  moment)

* Guides rework: better list page, i18n support, better loading time
  (pre-caching with hooks on the wiki?)

* Compatibility list search/autocompletion support
